    content: `## What Is Emergency Tyre Fitting?

Emergency tyre fitting is a mobile service where a certified fitter drives to your exact location — roadside, driveway, car park, or motorway hard shoulder — and replaces your damaged tyre on the spot. In Glasgow, Tyre Rescue provides this service 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.

**The short answer:** Call 0141 266 0690, tell us where you are, and a fitter reaches you in approximately 45 minutes with the right tyre for your vehicle.

## How Much Does Emergency Tyre Fitting Cost in Glasgow?

Emergency tyre fitting in Glasgow costs **£49 callout fee** plus the price of the tyre:

| Tyre Type | Price Range | Total (with callout) |
|-----------|------------|---------------------|
| Budget | £40–£60 | £89–£109 |
| Mid-range | £60–£100 | £109–£149 |
| Premium | £100–£150 | £149–£199 |

These prices cover a single tyre replacement including professional fitting, safety check, and old tyre disposal. There are no hidden charges — your fitter confirms the full price before starting work.

## How Fast Is the Response Time?

Our average emergency response times across Glasgow:

- **Glasgow City Centre** (G1–G4): 30 minutes
- **West End / Partick / Kelvingrove** (G11–G13): 35 minutes
- **Southside / Shawlands / Govan** (G41–G52): 35 minutes
- **East End / Dennistoun / Parkhead** (G31–G34): 25 minutes (closest to our base)
- **North / Maryhill / Springburn** (G20–G22): 40 minutes

Response times may vary during peak hours (8–9am, 5–7pm) and severe weather.

## What Happens When the Fitter Arrives?

1. **Assessment** — The fitter inspects the damaged tyre to confirm whether it needs replacement or can be repaired (puncture repairs from £25)
2. **Quote** — You receive the exact price before any work begins
3. **Fitting** — Professional tyre change using a hydraulic jack and torque wrench, typically 15–20 minutes per tyre
4. **Safety check** — Tyre pressure set to manufacturer spec, wheel bolts torqued correctly, visual check on remaining tyres
5. **Disposal** — Old tyre removed and disposed of responsibly at no extra charge
6. **Payment** — Card, Apple Pay, or Google Pay accepted on-site

## How to Stay Safe While Waiting

If you have a flat tyre on a road or motorway:

1. **Pull over** to the left as far as possible — hard shoulder on motorways, side street in the city
2. **Hazard lights on** — make yourself visible immediately
3. **Exit carefully** — leave the vehicle from the side furthest from traffic
4. **Stand behind the barrier** on motorways, or well away from the carriageway in town
5. **Call us** on 0141 266 0690 — stay on the line and we dispatch a fitter while you talk
6. **Do not attempt** to change the tyre yourself on a live road or motorway

## When Should You Call for Emergency Tyre Fitting?

Call immediately if:

- Your tyre is flat or losing pressure quickly
- You hear a loud bang or feel sudden vibration while driving
- You notice a bulge, crack, or exposed cords on the tyre sidewall
- Your tyre pressure warning light is on and the tyre looks visibly low
- You're stranded anywhere and cannot safely drive to a garage

## Emergency Tyre Fitting vs Breakdown Cover

| Feature | Tyre Rescue Emergency | Typical Breakdown Cover |
|---------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Response time | 45 min average | 1–3 hours |
| Tyre carried | Yes, fitted on-site | Usually towed to garage |
| 24/7 availability | Yes | Yes |
| Cost | £49 callout + tyre | Annual membership + potential extras |
| Tyre choice | Full range available | No choice (whatever garage has) |

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do you fit run-flat tyres in emergencies?
Yes. We carry common run-flat sizes for BMW, Mercedes, and Mini. Let us know your vehicle when calling so we can confirm stock before dispatching.

### Can you come to a motorway hard shoulder?
Yes. Our fitters are trained for roadside work and carry full safety equipment including high-visibility clothing, warning triangles, and LED beacons.

### What if you don't have my tyre size?
We stock over 200 common sizes on our vans. For unusual sizes, we can source and fit same-day in most cases. We'll always tell you before dispatching if there's a stock issue.

### Is there a charge if the puncture is repairable?
If we can repair the puncture instead of replacing the tyre, you pay £25 for the repair — no callout fee on top. We always try the cheaper option first.`,

    content: `## Stay Calm — Here's Exactly What to Do

A flat tyre on the motorway is frightening but manageable. Follow these steps in order and you'll be safe.

**Immediate answer:** Do NOT brake hard. Grip the steering wheel firmly, ease off the accelerator, signal left, and coast to the hard shoulder or emergency refuge area. Then call 0141 266 0690 for emergency tyre fitting.

## Step-by-Step: Flat Tyre on a Scottish Motorway

### Step 1: Get Off the Carriageway Safely

- **DO NOT slam the brakes** — this can cause a skid, especially with a rear blowout
- Grip the steering wheel with both hands to counteract any pulling
- Ease off the accelerator gradually
- Signal left and move to the hard shoulder or nearest emergency refuge area
- Stop as far left as possible, ideally on a straight section where other drivers can see you

### Step 2: Make Yourself Visible

- Turn on hazard lights immediately
- If it's dark, keep sidelights on
- If you have a warning triangle, place it 45 metres behind your vehicle (but only if it's safe to walk along the hard shoulder)

### Step 3: Exit the Vehicle Safely

- **Exit from the passenger (left) side** — never step out into live traffic
- All passengers should exit from the left side
- Move behind the motorway barrier if one exists
- Walk up the embankment away from the carriageway
- Take pets with you but leave luggage

### Step 4: Call for Emergency Tyre Fitting

Call Tyre Rescue on **0141 266 0690**. We need:

1. Your exact location (motorway name + direction + nearest junction or marker post)
2. Your vehicle make, model, and registration
3. Which tyre is flat (front/rear, left/right)
4. Your contact number

We dispatch a fitter immediately — average arrival time is 45 minutes on Glasgow motorways.

### Step 5: Wait Safely

- Stand well back from the hard shoulder behind the barrier
- Do NOT sit in your vehicle — in a collision, vehicles on the hard shoulder are hit from behind
- Keep your phone charged and available
- If conditions worsen (rain, dark), stay visible with reflective clothing if you have it

## Which Motorways Do We Cover?

| Motorway | Route | Coverage |
|----------|-------|----------|
| M8 | Glasgow–Edinburgh | Full coverage |
| M74 | Glasgow–Carlisle | Full coverage to Abington |
| M77 | Glasgow–Kilmarnock | Full coverage |
| M80 | Glasgow–Stirling | Full coverage |
| M73 | Maryville–Mollinsburn | Full coverage |
| M9 | Edinburgh–Stirling | Full coverage |
| A720 | Edinburgh City Bypass | Full coverage |

## Should You Change the Tyre Yourself?

**On a motorway: No.** The hard shoulder is one of the most dangerous places on the road network. Highways England data shows that 1 in 12 motorway deaths involve someone stopped on the hard shoulder.

Unless you are completely confident and conditions are safe (dry, daylight, wide hard shoulder, no Smart Motorway section), wait for a professional.

On a quiet residential street? A tyre change is straightforward if you have a jack and spare. But if you're unsure, calling a mobile fitter is the safer choice.

## How to Prevent Motorway Tyre Failures

1. **Check tyre pressure monthly** — underinflation is the leading cause of blowouts
2. **Inspect tread depth** — legal minimum is 1.6mm but replace at 3mm for safety
3. **Look for damage** — bulges, cracks, or embedded objects mean the tyre needs attention
4. **Don't overload** — check your vehicle's weight limits, especially before long trips
5. **Replace old tyres** — even with good tread, tyres over 5 years old lose structural integrity

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much does motorway emergency tyre fitting cost?
£49 callout plus the tyre cost (£40–£150 depending on size and brand). No extra charge for motorway callouts.

### Can you come to a Smart Motorway section?
Yes, but you must be in an emergency refuge area. If you're stuck in a live lane, call 999 first, then call us once you're safe.

### How long will I wait on the hard shoulder?
Our average response on Glasgow motorways is 45 minutes. We'll give you an accurate ETA when you call.`,

    content: `## The Short Answer

Mobile tyre fitting is better if you value convenience and time. A garage is better if you need complex wheel work (alignment, balancing machines) or have an unusual vehicle. For standard tyre replacement, mobile fitting delivers the same quality at comparable cost — at your location.

## Side-by-Side Comparison

| Factor | Mobile Tyre Fitting | Garage Visit |
|--------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Location** | Your home, work, or roadside | You drive to them |
| **Wait time** | 15-20 mins per tyre (you watch) | 30-90 mins (you wait inside) |
| **Scheduling** | Same-day, often within hours | May need to book days ahead |
| **24/7 availability** | Yes (emergency) | Typically Mon-Sat daytime |
| **Travel required** | None — fitter comes to you | You drive there and back |
| **Fitting cost** | From £20 per tyre | From £10-15 per tyre |
| **Tyre choice** | Range on van + can source | Full showroom range |
| **Equipment** | Professional portable gear | Fixed workshop equipment |
| **Wheel alignment** | Not usually available | Available |
| **Convenience** | Very high | Low-moderate |

## When Mobile Fitting Wins

### 1. You Can't Drive to a Garage
Flat tyre, blowout, or tyre damage that makes the vehicle undrivable. This is the most common reason people call us — and it's not even close. If your tyre is flat, driving to a garage on the rim damages the wheel.

### 2. You Don't Have Time to Sit in a Waiting Room
A mobile fitter works at your location. While they fit your tyres, you're at home having coffee, or at your desk working. No lost afternoon.

### 3. You Need Tyres Fitted Outside Business Hours
Most garages close at 5-6pm and aren't open on Sundays. Tyre Rescue operates 24/7 including bank holidays.

### 4. Fleet Vehicles
If you manage vehicles for a business, having a mobile fitter come to your yard is dramatically more efficient than sending each vehicle to a garage.

### 5. You Have Young Children or Mobility Issues
Loading kids into a car to sit in a waiting room, or negotiating a garage forecourt with mobility aids — mobile fitting eliminates all of this.

## When a Garage Wins

### 1. Wheel Alignment
After fitting new tyres, alignment is recommended — especially if you hit a pothole. Mobile fitters don't carry alignment rigs. Most garages do.

### 2. Complex Wheel Work
Bent alloys, tyre balancing with precision machines, or TPMS sensor programming — these sometimes need workshop equipment.

### 3. Budget Fitting Cost
Garage labour rates for fitting-only (you supply the tyre) can be £10-15 per tyre. Mobile is typically £20. The difference is the convenience premium.

### 4. Browsing Tyres in Person
Some drivers prefer to see the tyre before buying. Garages have showroom displays. With mobile fitting, you choose online or by phone.

## Quality: Is Mobile Fitting as Good?

Yes. Mobile fitters use:

- **Hydraulic jacks** rated for your vehicle weight
- **Calibrated torque wrenches** to manufacturer specifications
- **TPMS sensors** — we reset your tyre pressure monitoring system
- **Professional tyre changers** — portable but professional-grade

The tyre is the same product. The fitting process is identical. The only difference is the location.

At Tyre Rescue, all fitters are fully insured and trained. The job comes with the same warranty whether done in a workshop or your driveway.

## Cost Breakdown: Real Numbers

**Scenario:** You need 2 new 205/55R16 tyres (common size for Ford Focus, VW Golf, etc.)

### Mobile Fitting (Tyre Rescue)
- 2x mid-range tyres: £140
- Fitting (£20 x 2): £40
- Old tyre disposal: Free
- **Total: £180**
- Time away from your day: **0 minutes** (fitter works while you continue your routine)

### Garage Visit (Typical Glasgow)
- 2x mid-range tyres: £130
- Fitting + balancing (£15 x 2): £30
- Old tyre disposal: £2 x 2 = £4
- **Total: £164**
- Time away from your day: **90-120 minutes** (drive there, wait, drive back)

The £16 difference buys you back 2 hours of your day. For most people, that's a clear win for mobile.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can a mobile fitter balance my wheels?
Basic balancing is possible with portable equipment, but for precision balancing we'd recommend a garage. Most tyre replacements don't require separate balancing — the tyre is pre-balanced during manufacture.

### Do mobile fitters offer the same tyre brands?
Yes. We carry Hankook, Continental, Michelin, Bridgestone, Pirelli, and quality budget brands. If we don't have your exact size on the van, we source it same-day.

### Is it safe to have tyres fitted on a driveway?
Completely safe. We assess the ground surface before starting. A level driveway or car park is an ideal working surface — often better than a cramped garage ramp.

### Can I book a specific time for mobile fitting?
Yes. For non-emergency fittings, you choose a time slot that works for you. We confirm a 2-hour window and call 30 minutes before arrival.`,

    content: `## Your Monthly Tyre Check in 5 Minutes

Scottish roads, rain, and temperature swings are hard on tyres. A 5-minute monthly check prevents blowouts, improves fuel economy, and keeps you legal. Here's what to check.

**Quick answer:** Check pressure, tread depth, and visual condition once a month and before any long journey. It takes 5 minutes and could save your life.

## 1. Tyre Pressure

### Why It Matters
Underinflated tyres are the single biggest cause of blowouts. They also:
- Increase fuel consumption by up to 3%
- Wear unevenly (edges wear faster)
- Handle poorly in wet conditions
- Increase braking distance

### How to Check
1. Find your vehicle's recommended pressure — it's on a sticker inside the driver's door or in the owner's manual
2. Check when the tyres are **cold** (not driven for 2+ hours)
3. Use a digital gauge (more accurate than pencil-type)
4. Check all four tyres **and the spare**
5. Adjust to the correct PSI at a petrol station air pump

### Scottish-Specific Tip
Temperature drops of 10°C can reduce tyre pressure by 1-2 PSI. In Scotland, where temperatures can swing 15°C between day and night in spring/autumn, check more frequently during seasonal changes.

## 2. Tread Depth

### Legal Requirements
The UK legal minimum tread depth is **1.6mm** across the central three quarters of the tyre. However:

- **1.6mm is the bare legal minimum** — braking performance is significantly worse
- **3mm is the safety threshold** — we recommend replacing at this point
- **Below 3mm in wet conditions** increases stopping distance by up to 44%

### How to Check
**The 20p test:**
1. Insert a 20p coin into the main tread grooves
2. If you can see the outer band of the coin, your tread is below 3mm
3. Check at three points across the tyre width
4. Check at several points around the circumference

### Penalty for Illegal Tyres
- **£2,500 fine per tyre**
- **3 penalty points per tyre**
- 4 illegal tyres = 12 points = automatic ban

## 3. Visual Inspection

Look for these warning signs every time you walk to your car:

| What to Look For | What It Means | Action |
|-----------------|---------------|--------|
| Bulge on sidewall | Internal structural damage | Replace immediately — tyre could blow |
| Cracks in rubber | Age or UV degradation | Replace soon, especially if deep |
| Embedded objects | Nail, screw, glass | May be repairable — call for assessment |
| Uneven wear (inner edge) | Alignment issue | Get alignment checked + consider new tyres |
| Uneven wear (centre) | Over-inflation | Adjust pressure and monitor |
| Uneven wear (both edges) | Under-inflation | Adjust pressure and monitor |
| Flat spots | Brake lockup or sitting too long | Usually temporary; replace if persistent |

## 4. Seasonal Considerations for Scotland

### Winter (November–March)
- Check pressure more frequently (cold reduces PSI)
- Consider winter tyres if you regularly drive in Highlands or rural areas
- All-season tyres are a good compromise for Glasgow/Edinburgh city driving
- Watch for pothole damage after freeze-thaw cycles

### Summer (April–October)
- Hot tarmac increases tyre temperature — don't over-inflate
- Check for cracking if tyres are over 3 years old
- UV exposure degrades rubber — inspect sidewalls

### Year-Round Scotland Issues
- Potholes — Glasgow and Edinburgh roads are notoriously potholed. After any impact, check for bulges
- Standing water — worn tyres aquaplane easily on Scotland's wet roads
- Debris — country roads often have sharp stones, hedge cuttings, and farm equipment remnants

## 5. When to Replace Your Tyres

Replace immediately if:
- Tread depth is at or below 1.6mm anywhere
- There's a bulge or blister on the sidewall
- You can see cords or metal through the rubber
- The tyre is over 10 years old (check the DOT date code)

Replace soon if:
- Tread is at 3mm or below
- Cracking is visible on the sidewall
- The tyre is over 5 years old regardless of tread
- You notice vibration or pulling when driving

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How often should I check my tyres?
Monthly and before any journey over 100 miles. It takes 5 minutes.

### Where can I get my tyres checked in Glasgow?
Tyre Rescue offers free tyre condition assessments with any mobile fitting appointment. Call 0141 266 0690 to book.

### Do I need winter tyres in Glasgow?
For city driving, all-season tyres are usually sufficient. If you regularly drive to the Highlands or rural areas in winter, dedicated winter tyres provide significantly better grip below 7°C.

### How do I find my tyre size?
Look on the tyre sidewall — you'll see markings like **205/55R16 91V**. This tells us everything we need to match the correct replacement.`,

    content: `## 7 Warning Signs Your Tyres Need Replacing

Your tyres are the only part of your vehicle touching the road. When they're worn, everything suffers — braking, cornering, fuel economy, and safety. Here are the signs you need new tyres.

**Quick answer:** If your tread is at or below 3mm, you have sidewall damage, or your tyres are over 5 years old, it's time for replacements. Call 0141 266 0690 for mobile tyre fitting in Glasgow.

## 1. Low Tread Depth

The most obvious sign. UK law requires a minimum of 1.6mm, but braking performance drops significantly below 3mm — especially in wet Scottish conditions.

**How to check:** Insert a 20p coin into the tread grooves. If you can see the outer band, you're at or below the replacement threshold.

Modern tyres also have **tread wear indicators** — small raised bars inside the grooves. When the tread surface is level with these bars, the tyre is legally worn out.

## 2. Sidewall Bulges or Blisters

A bulge on the tyre sidewall means the internal structure has been damaged — usually from hitting a pothole or kerb. This is a tyre failure waiting to happen.

**Action:** Replace immediately. A bulging tyre cannot be repaired and could blow out at any speed.

## 3. Visible Cracks

Small cracks in the sidewall rubber indicate age or UV degradation. The rubber compound dries out over time, losing its flexibility and grip.

**When to worry:** Surface crazing is cosmetic. Deep cracks that you can feel with a fingernail mean the tyre needs replacing, even if tread depth is still good.

## 4. Vibration While Driving

Some vibration is normal on rough roads. But if you feel new, persistent vibration through the steering wheel or seat:

- **At all speeds:** Could be a tyre defect or internal damage
- **Only at high speed (60mph+):** Likely a balance issue
- **When braking:** Could be a flat spot from a brake lockup

Any new vibration warrants a tyre inspection.

## 5. Uneven Wear Patterns

| Wear Pattern | Cause | Fix |
|-------------|-------|-----|
| Centre worn, edges fine | Over-inflation | Reduce pressure to recommended PSI |
| Edges worn, centre fine | Under-inflation | Increase pressure to recommended PSI |
| One edge worn | Alignment problem | Get alignment checked |
| Patchy/cupping wear | Suspension fault | Check suspension + replace tyre |
| Feathered edges | Toe alignment issue | Alignment check needed |

Uneven wear means the tyre isn't making proper contact with the road. Even if tread depth looks adequate, the wear pattern means reduced grip.

## 6. Age (Over 5 Years)

Even if a tyre looks fine and has plenty of tread, the rubber compound degrades over time. After 5 years, the rubber loses elasticity and grip — particularly in cold, wet Scottish conditions.

**How to check the age:** Look for the DOT code on the sidewall. The last four digits indicate the week and year of manufacture. For example, **2321** means week 23 of 2021.

Tyres over 10 years old should be replaced regardless of condition.

## 7. Your Car Pulls to One Side

If your vehicle drifts left or right when driving straight on a flat road, it could indicate:

- Uneven tyre wear
- Different tread depths front-to-rear
- Internal tyre damage
- Alignment issues

First check that all four tyres are at the correct pressure. If the pull persists, a tyre inspection will identify the cause.

## What to Do Next

If you've spotted any of these signs, don't wait. Driving on damaged or worn tyres in Scotland's wet conditions is dangerous and potentially illegal.

**For Glasgow and Edinburgh:** Call Tyre Rescue on 0141 266 0690. We'll come to your location, assess all four tyres, and replace whatever's needed. Mobile fitting from £20 per tyre, available 24/7.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I just replace one tyre?
Yes, if only one tyre is worn or damaged. We recommend fitting the new tyre on the rear axle for better stability — we'll move existing tyres around if needed.

### How many miles do tyres last?
Typically 20,000–40,000 miles depending on driving style, vehicle weight, and tyre quality. Front tyres wear faster on front-wheel-drive vehicles (most cars).

### Are part-worn tyres safe?
We don't recommend part-worn tyres. You don't know their history — they may have been run flat, overheated, or improperly stored. The small cost saving isn't worth the safety risk.`,
